perlpop must be started as root in order to set up the listening
socket on port 110, but immediately drops special priveleges and runs
as a less priveleged user.  It will accept up to 20 concurrent
connections, and will only let any particular IP address make 3
concurrent connections.  Each connection has a 30 second idle timeout.

You may choose perlpop over various other pop3 implementations,
because it was programmed entirely in perl, making it easy to modify,
while still serving connections very fast.  Once the daemon is loaded
into memory, it's speeds rival many top competitors.  In addition,
the daemon takes a total of about 5MB memory.
